# Naive_Bayes_Implementation
Naive Bayes implementation on Python for csv Data

Naive Bayes Algorithm on Python has been developed from scratch. An existing naive bayes algorithm implementation of Scikit learn library is also demonstrated.

This has been applied on the famous "pima-indian" data in the form of csv file.

For this dataset Scikit learn (Naive bayes) is also used but other Classification algorithm (like SVM, KNN etc.) have been imported and For all the Classifiers, Accuracy for this dataset can be compared.
